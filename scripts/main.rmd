```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Procedure

1. Get landfire classification for each observation
2. Use dplyr to count the landfire classes aggregated by species
3. For each species, limit the landfire classes to those above 10% and sum the rasters together
4. Mask the range raster for each species by the landfire raster from step #3
5. Save the resulting range raster for each species
6. Repeat for different resolutions
7. Profit.
